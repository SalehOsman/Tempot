## Toolchain

This project uses two mandatory toolchains. You MUST use their
commands and skills as specified below.

### SpecKit (Specification Artifacts)

The following artifacts were produced by SpecKit and are your
source of truth for WHAT to build:

| Artifact | Produced by                             | Path                                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Spec     | `/speckit.specify` + `/speckit.clarify` | `specs/{NNN}-{FEATURE_NAME}/spec.md`  |
| Plan     | `/speckit.plan`                         | `specs/{NNN}-{FEATURE_NAME}/plan.md`  |
| Tasks    | `/speckit.tasks`                        | `specs/{NNN}-{FEATURE_NAME}/tasks.md` |
| Analyze  | `/speckit.analyze`                      | Passed with 0 critical issues         |

Read all artifacts before starting.

### Superpowers (Execution Skills)

Use these skills for HOW to build. Activate each via the Skill
tool before starting its phase.

**Subagent selection rules (subagent-driven-development):**

- One implementer subagent per task — NEVER parallel implementers.
- After each implementer: dispatch spec-reviewer subagent, then code-quality-reviewer subagent.
- Use `dispatching-parallel-agents` ONLY for tasks that are fully independent (no shared files, no sequential dependency).

## What This Package Does

{PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION}

**Core components:**
{COMPONENT_LIST}

**Key dependencies:**
{DEPENDENCIES}

**Design concerns to address during brainstorming:**
{DESIGN_CONCERNS}

## Execute

Do not improvise the workflow — activate the required skill and
follow its instructions exactly.

1. **Activate `brainstorming`** — Read spec.md + plan.md. Deepen the technical design via Socratic questions. Address the design concerns listed above. Save design doc to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-{FEATURE}-design.md`. No code in this phase.

2. **Activate `using-git-worktrees`** — Create isolated branch: `feature/{NNN}-{FEATURE_NAME}`.

3. **Activate `writing-plans`** — Convert tasks.md + design doc into granular 2-5 min executable tasks. Each task follows TDD cycle (use `test-driven-development` skill as reference). Save to `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-{FEATURE}.md`. Dispatch plan-document-reviewer subagent before proceeding.

4. **Activate `subagent-driven-development`** — Before writing any code, study the structure and patterns of an existing package (e.g., `{REFERENCE_PACKAGE}`) to follow established conventions. Run package-creation-checklist before first line of code. Execute tasks sequentially. Per task: implementer subagent → spec-reviewer → code-quality-reviewer. TDD is mandatory (`test-driven-development` skill). If an unexpected error occurs during any task, activate `systematic-debugging` before proceeding.

5. **Activate `requesting-code-review`** — Review all changes against spec.md + constitution. Zero CRITICAL issues to proceed. If issues are found, activate `receiving-code-review` to address them.

6. **Activate `verification-before-completion`** — Run full test suite and build. Paste actual output as evidence. No claims without evidence.

7. **Documentation Sync (MANDATORY — Constitution Rule L)**

   Code and documentation MUST be in perfect alignment. After verification
   passes but BEFORE merge, update ALL affected documentation:

   **A. SpecKit Artifacts** — Update these in `specs/{NNN}-{FEATURE_NAME}/`
   if the implementation changed anything they describe:
   - `data-model.md`: new/changed entities, fields, events, interfaces, type registries
   - `tasks.md`: acceptance criteria reflecting actual implementation (mark completed, add new)
   - `research.md`: new technical decisions made during implementation (add as numbered Decision)
   - `spec.md`: only if edge cases, requirements, or functional requirements changed

   **B. Spec Consistency Gate** — Run `/speckit.analyze` to verify internal
   consistency between updated SpecKit artifacts (spec ↔ plan ↔ tasks ↔ data-model):

   ```
   /speckit.analyze
   ```

   `/speckit.analyze` is a SpecKit slash command — run it in the same way you run other SpecKit commands (e.g., `/speckit.specify`). It is NOT a shell command.

   Fix any inconsistencies before proceeding.

   **C. Reconciliation Gate** — Run `pnpm spec:validate` to verify spec→code alignment:

   ```bash
   pnpm spec:validate {NNN}-{FEATURE_NAME}
   ```

   - Exit 0: continue to next step
   - Exit 1: fix HIGH/MEDIUM issues or document justification for deferral
   - Exit 2: BLOCKED — fix all CRITICAL issues before proceeding

   **C. Project Documentation** — Update ALL that apply:
   - `docs/ROADMAP.md` — ALWAYS (Rule LXXXIX). Update "Last updated" date and "Next Action" section
   - `docs/architecture/adr/README.md` — if any new ADR was created, add its row to the index table
   - `CLAUDE.md` — if any new dependency was added to the project, update the tech stack table
   - `docs/tempot_v11_final.md` — if architectural patterns, guarantees, or ADR listings changed
   - `docs/developer/package-creation-checklist.md` — if a new quality gate was introduced
   - `docs/developer/workflow-guide.md` — if workflow steps changed

   **D. Changeset** — Create a changeset for the changes:

   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```

   Select the affected package(s), change type (patch/minor/major), and write a summary.

   **E. Re-validate** — Run `pnpm spec:validate` again after documentation updates to confirm
   no new inconsistencies were introduced.

8. **Activate `finishing-a-development-branch`** — Merge to main.

## Constraints

- If any gate fails or you encounter ambiguity not covered by the spec: STOP. Do NOT attempt to fix, workaround, or decide independently. Report the exact failure and wait.
- Do ONLY what spec.md requires. No bonus features, no refactoring of unrelated code, no "while I'm here" changes.
- Every public API returns `Result<T, AppError>` via neverthrow.
- All code, comments, variables in English.

## Pre-Report Checklist

- [ ] All affected documentation updated (Constitution Rule L)
- [ ] `/speckit.analyze` passed (paste output)
- [ ] `pnpm spec:validate` passed (paste output)
- [ ] Changeset created via `pnpm changeset`

## Final Report

When all phases complete, report:

- Design doc path
- Branch name
- Tasks executed (count)
- Test results with output evidence
- Code review summary (issues by severity)
- Documentation sync: list every documentation file updated and what changed
